### Patch Changes

- [#835](https://github.com/conciv-dev/conciv/pull/835) [`33345d3`](https://github.com/conciv-dev/conciv/commit/33345d3bbc25419086a899a36f96991ae37a59ae) Thanks [@omridevk](https://github.com/omridevk)! - The hub talks to engines over the typed oRPC contract. `conciv mcp serve` now calls `code.execute`, `code.discover`, `code.describe`, `tabs.get` and `page.queue.wait` instead of reading MCP text from `/api/mcp`, so a queue call becomes an MCP task whenever the script started a queue, whatever it returns, and a script that only returns a queue-shaped object no longer does. `GET /api/tabs` is replaced by `tabs.list` / `tabs.get`; an engine without them is reported as too old. `/api/mcp` and `code.execute` run one shared engine function. The image helpers (`imagesIn`, `withoutImages`, `imageBlocks`) move from `@conciv/ai/server` to `@conciv/protocol/chat-message-types`.

  `page_queue` now plays the list and returns every outcome in the same call (if the list outlasts 120 s it returns the progress so far plus a queueId and the rest arrives on its own); `page_queue_async` answers with a queueId at once and pushes the outcomes back when the list ends. `page_queue_wait` is gone as an agent tool; only queues still playing when a call returns become an MCP task.

- [#834](https://github.com/conciv-dev/conciv/pull/834) [`cba0682`](https://github.com/conciv-dev/conciv/commit/cba0682d62058e28428ebbfc64a3a1422ba6bf77) Thanks [@omridevk](https://github.com/omridevk)! - The widget no longer polls. `meta.hubAgents` is an event iterator the engine pushes whenever the conciv home db changes on disk, so an agent connected or disconnected from the CLI shows up at once. The engine staleness read refreshes on reconnect and refocus instead of a timer, and reachability comes only from the engine socket (`engineProbeRefetchInterval` and `voteEngineProbeSettled` are gone). The recorder panel follows a `replay` stream until the recording can be replayed and a pushed `events` stream for the live tail, replacing its 1 s polls.

- [#798](https://github.com/conciv-dev/conciv/pull/798) [`eaa4b2a`](https://github.com/conciv-dev/conciv/commit/eaa4b2a94f44bbfeb14b6a85b343cd16a9c2d743) Thanks [@omridevk](https://github.com/omridevk)! - Every browser oRPC call now rides one reconnecting WebSocket per engine (`/rpc-ws`) instead of HTTP. The socket reconnects on its own, open streams such as `sessions.changes` resubscribe after an engine restart or a laptop sleep, and reachability follows the socket's open and close. Trust is per connection: a socket serves only the login procedures until its first trust frame or auth call trusts it, and a revoked token closes the socket and stops it reconnecting. The HTTP `/rpc` handler stays for node clients.

- [#813](https://github.com/conciv-dev/conciv/pull/813) [`7925199`](https://github.com/conciv-dev/conciv/commit/79251997f75892d7b445f3dbebb1dbb5109aac53) Thanks [@omridevk](https://github.com/omridevk)! - The browser transport sends its oRPC frames through its own peer client and drops an abort frame for a socket that is not open, so cancelling a call while the socket closes no longer leaves an unhandled "Cannot send message, WebSocket is not open." rejection. A request that cannot be sent still rejects its call, and a frame from the dev server that cannot be read is logged and fails the calls in flight instead of rejecting unhandled. A blocked or full localStorage keeps the engine token in memory; any other storage error is no longer swallowed. This replaces the pnpm patch on `@orpc/standard-server-peer`, which never reached npm consumers.

### Patch Changes

- [#742](https://github.com/conciv-dev/conciv/pull/742) [`0ff249d`](https://github.com/conciv-dev/conciv/commit/0ff249d2a4fd84fb3325d150ce48b061bfdcbe0b) Thanks [@omridevk](https://github.com/omridevk)! - Long chats open with their newest 50 messages and load older pages as you scroll up, without moving the message in view. Harness labels, dividers and stopped markers are keyed by message id so they stay on their messages across pages.

  Chat transcripts are stored one row per message (`chat_messages`), so a page of history reads only that page from the database; existing chats are moved over by a migration.

- [#726](https://github.com/conciv-dev/conciv/pull/726) [`bbc5760`](https://github.com/conciv-dev/conciv/commit/bbc57606fd20f68b991cb04690fa42ce99c7cafd) Thanks [@omridevk](https://github.com/omridevk)! - The engine now refuses every request from a browser it does not trust. A browser becomes trusted by entering the 6-digit code the dev server prints (or opening the printed link); the widget shows a locked launcher until then. Inside the Vite DevTools dock the widget is trusted through DevTools' own login. `conciv auth revoke [id] [--all]` lists and removes trusted browsers.

  Revoking a browser takes effect on the running engine without a restart. The open `/health` route now answers only `{ok, harness, engine: {stale}}`; the full staleness reading stays on the gated `meta.engine` RPC. When any engine call answers 401 the widget checks its login again and shows the locked launcher if the engine no longer trusts it; Retry on the unreachable screen does the same check. A revoke also closes every socket the browser opened (close code 1008), which locks an open tab right away. A missing session header now answers 400 BAD_REQUEST, so 401 only means the login gate refused.

  The launcher now drags like the TanStack Devtools trigger: drop it anywhere, throw it, pin it into a corner, or drag it off an edge to tuck it into a tab (click the tab to bring it back). Arrows move the focused launcher and Shift with an arrow sends it to a corner. The chat panel opens toward the free side of wherever the launcher sits, and the spot is remembered per browser.

- [#791](https://github.com/conciv-dev/conciv/pull/791) [`b591c13`](https://github.com/conciv-dev/conciv/commit/b591c138b32b293a14f1d3f2dc92d5c58889402c) Thanks [@omridevk](https://github.com/omridevk)! - A navigation made right before a reload or tab close is no longer lost. The widget flushes its pending navigation write when the page turns hidden and sends it as a keepalive request, so a reload restores the screen the user just saw: picking a session and reloading at once no longer brings the session menu back open.

- [#747](https://github.com/conciv-dev/conciv/pull/747) [`238ccf4`](https://github.com/conciv-dev/conciv/commit/238ccf4fca0ff9e135bf130f1a32f537cad416a8) Thanks [@omridevk](https://github.com/omridevk)! - Packages now report their real release version, for future migrations; a version difference never breaks anything. `conciv` carries it as its `meta.version`, the Claude Code connect plugin is stamped with it instead of `0.0.0`, and every engine response carries an `x-conciv-version` header. Node rpc clients send their own version in the same header; browser requests send no new header, so a newer widget still reaches an older engine. When the engine is older than the widget (or predates versions), the panel shows a notice asking to update the @conciv packages. `conciv init` now also runs `claude plugin update`, so an install recorded at an earlier release moves onto the current one.

- [#746](https://github.com/conciv-dev/conciv/pull/746) [`2721b7c`](https://github.com/conciv-dev/conciv/commit/2721b7cb943e4bfdedc5ae12024d2ed0f6c60ca2) Thanks [@omridevk](https://github.com/omridevk)! - The session list is paged with a cursor and searchable on the server.

  - `sessions.list` takes `{cursor, limit}` and returns `{sessions, next}`. Each harness reads only the transcripts on the requested page instead of its newest 50. `sessions.get` returns one session.
  - `sessions.search` searches session titles and message text across every harness that has transcript history. The index is an in-memory Orama index held in a worker thread, built in the background after the first list. Nothing is written to disk. `sessions.changes` streams the index version: the current one on subscribe, then each new one; the picker keys its list and search queries on it, so they refetch when indexing lands.
  - Claude sessions are listed through the Claude Agent SDK and follow `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`. Empty and continued sessions are hidden, as in `/resume`. Codex, OpenCode and Pi answer `meta` for a single session. Transcripts are read as streams.
  - Sessions show their transcript size instead of a message count.
  - The session picker is a virtual list that loads more as you scroll and searches as you type. The search input takes pointer clicks and keeps focus while results arrive, and Today and Yesterday split at local midnight.
  - A session whose native transcript is gone no longer appears in the list.

- [#776](https://github.com/conciv-dev/conciv/pull/776) [`913bf6e`](https://github.com/conciv-dev/conciv/commit/913bf6e383d82ac9b96df4e723909bde74a5a41c) Thanks [@omridevk](https://github.com/omridevk)! - The session picker previews the highlighted session beside the list: a read-only thread of its transcript, newest messages first with earlier pages loading on scroll, the search words marked, `Alt+ArrowRight` to read it and `Alt+ArrowLeft` back to the search, Escape closing the preview before the picker. Core serves it through the read-only `sessions.preview` procedure. Search marks now come from Ark `Highlight` and zag `highlightWord`, and keyboard hints share one ui-kit-system `Kbd`. `Thread.Messages` takes `readOnly`, which leaves the assistant action bar with Copy only; the preview sets it. With All projects on, another project's hit previews too: `sessions.preview` takes that hit's `cwd`, and the preview header copies its resume command through the same `createResumeCopy` as the row, so both show Copied together. `ClipboardCopyButton` can reflect a shared `ClipboardCopy` instead of its own. Previewing a session from a folder the search index does not cover yet adds that folder to the index in the background. The preview opens after 600 ms, closes when its session leaves the results, and its header copy button keeps its own Copied state with a 44px hit area. Typing in the search closes the preview. `TooltipIconButton` takes `keepOpenOnClick`, and `ClipboardCopyButton` uses it so its Copied tooltip stays visible after the click.

- [#776](https://github.com/conciv-dev/conciv/pull/776) [`913bf6e`](https://github.com/conciv-dev/conciv/commit/913bf6e383d82ac9b96df4e723909bde74a5a41c) Thanks [@omridevk](https://github.com/omridevk)! - Session search can cover every project. The picker's search area gains an "All projects" switch; a hit from another project shows that project's folder, and selecting it copies the command that resumes it there instead of opening it here. The search term and the switch live in the URL, so closing the picker or reloading keeps them. `sessions.search` takes `everywhere`, and each hit carries `cwd` and `resume`.

- [#776](https://github.com/conciv-dev/conciv/pull/776) [`913bf6e`](https://github.com/conciv-dev/conciv/commit/913bf6e383d82ac9b96df4e723909bde74a5a41c) Thanks [@omridevk](https://github.com/omridevk)! - A session search hit now shows a short excerpt from the line that matched, with the matched words highlighted in the excerpt and the title, so you can tell why a session was found before opening it.

- [#779](https://github.com/conciv-dev/conciv/pull/779) [`d1ac2b9`](https://github.com/conciv-dev/conciv/commit/d1ac2b9749d82f70effb017557605a301bc59986) Thanks [@omridevk](https://github.com/omridevk)! - Extensions and the app get persisted settings with Devframe's settings contract: `scope(namespace).settings.global` and `.project` on the server API, `getHostApi().useScope(namespace).settings` in the client, both backed by one JSON file per scope and namespace and kept in sync over the new `settings` procedures.

  ai-code-mode 0.4.3, ai-isolate-node 0.1.51, ai-isolate-quickjs 0.3.1, ai-mcp 0.3.4, ai-sandbox 0.5.0,
  ai-sandbox-local-process 0.2.4, ai-claude-code/ai-codex 0.4.4, ai-opencode/ai-acp 0.3.4). Upstream
  moved every sibling package's peer range from an exact pin to a caret range, so the pnpm catalog
  comment explaining the old exact-pin poison is rewritten. Code Mode's dynamic binding hook was
  renamed `getSkillBindings` → `getSnippetBindings` upstream; a per-turn `RUN_FINISHED` token-usage
  chunk can now arrive as either the legacy `TokenUsage` shape or the new AG-UI spec `usage[]` array,
  so the run-log fold rebuilds it with `fromSpecTokenUsage` before turning it into a usage snapshot.

- [#485](https://github.com/conciv-dev/conciv/pull/485) [`958dde7`](https://github.com/conciv-dev/conciv/commit/958dde7a862c8cfd735c2232ca13cef659b301f3) Thanks [@omridevk](https://github.com/omridevk)! - Global engine-reachability handling: reachability seam + single rebindable rpc client factory in contract, router error boundary with /panel/latest sentinel, one standing offline notice per window context, composer send disabled while unreachable.

- [#556](https://github.com/conciv-dev/conciv/pull/556) [`09f620a`](https://github.com/conciv-dev/conciv/commit/09f620a62d8d65e5721dd16eeaf7f2651225975e) Thanks [@omridevk](https://github.com/omridevk)! - Fix a JS event listener leak in the browser RPC websocket's reconnect path: partysocket's `ReconnectingWebSocket` registers a dangling `error` listener on each discarded socket during its internal auto-reconnect loop and never removes it, so a persistently unreachable engine accumulated listeners without bound. The websocket now makes a single bounded connection attempt per cycle and reconnection is driven externally with capped exponential backoff, cutting the per-outage reconnect rate (and the leak with it) by more than an order of magnitude while preserving automatic recovery once the engine comes back.

- [#597](https://github.com/conciv-dev/conciv/pull/597) [`d07737b`](https://github.com/conciv-dev/conciv/commit/d07737b093afd7e373ca7abd7c918cc572bd83d6) Thanks [@omridevk](https://github.com/omridevk)! - Bump the `@tanstack/ai` family from the 0.48 lockstep to 0.51 (catalog-only, see `pnpm-workspace.yaml`).
  Picks up upstream fix [#1248](https://github.com/TanStack/ai/pull/1248): the client `StreamProcessor`
  dropped the first `TEXT_MESSAGE_CONTENT` delta of an assistant turn that called a tool before
  replying, so every answer that followed a tool call lost its opening text (an opening code fence,
  most visibly).

- [#523](https://github.com/conciv-dev/conciv/pull/523) [`1cb8a51`](https://github.com/conciv-dev/conciv/commit/1cb8a51610a59d764ce064216a50b5209d28bde0) Thanks [@omridevk](https://github.com/omridevk)! - Export `ChatSendInput` so the rpc wire watcher asserts against the real `chat.send` schema instead of a looser copy.

### Patch Changes

- [#349](https://github.com/conciv-dev/conciv/pull/349) [`ea23bf6`](https://github.com/conciv-dev/conciv/commit/ea23bf6fa956703ba66399513c5de4af40770323) Thanks [@omridevk](https://github.com/omridevk)! - Browser rpc rides one websocket per (tab, apiBase).

  `makeBrowserRpcClient`, `makeDeferredRpcClient`, `makeRebindableRpcClient` and the browser form of
  `makeExtRpcClient` now resolve a shared connection from a versioned `globalThis` registry instead of
  building a fetch link each. The connection picks its transport once, at boot, by dialling `/rpc-ws`
  with a bounded open timeout and sticking to fetch/SSE when that fails; `widget.transport` pins either
  transport explicitly. `makeRpcClient` stays on fetch for the CLI, testkit and node integration tests.

  This removes the six-connection starvation that broke the widget from the third tab onwards.

- [#349](https://github.com/conciv-dev/conciv/pull/349) [`ea23bf6`](https://github.com/conciv-dev/conciv/commit/ea23bf6fa956703ba66399513c5de4af40770323) Thanks [@omridevk](https://github.com/omridevk)! - Closing a browser rpc connection no longer raises an unhandled error.

  A disposed connection now answers writes itself instead of letting them reach a dead socket: peer
  control frames (cancellations and client event-iterator payloads) are dropped, so oRPC's abort path
  runs to completion and closes the call it was cancelling, while a request frame still fails fast so a
  caller holding a stale link learns the connection is gone instead of hanging. Dispose delivers a
  close event only when partysocket's own `close()` emits none — it already dispatches one
  synchronously unless the socket never dialled or is already closing — so the peer observes exactly
  one terminal event.

  Unmounting the widget now releases the tab's connection: the socket is closed and the registry entry
  dropped, instead of leaving partysocket and its reconnect timers alive for the rest of the tab's
  life. A later mount re-creates the connection through the same registry, running the full transport
  probe again.

  `handle.rebind` now drops the old connection before tearing its consumers down, and rebinding to the
  base the widget is already on re-runs the probe rather than being a no-op, so a tab that fell back to
  fetch/SSE while the engine was unreachable can ride the websocket again once it recovers.

  A live connection reports partysocket's real state: open while open, connecting while it will
  reconnect, closed once it will not, so oRPC fails a send fast instead of waiting on a socket that is
  never coming back.

  The server stack moved from h3/srvx to hono behind one `@conciv/serve` wrapper for `@hono/node-server`, and the extension bundler was split out of the vite plugin into a standalone `@conciv/extension-compiler`.

  The terminal gains a narrative activity rail (a resizable, open-by-default timeline of session activity), and the pty now spawns at the attaching client's fitted size instead of bouncing through a fixed geometry on every attach.
