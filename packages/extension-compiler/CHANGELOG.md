### Patch Changes

- [#126](https://github.com/conciv-dev/conciv/pull/126) [`85ad5da`](https://github.com/conciv-dev/conciv/commit/85ad5da09b83fa1a263578620d9ad2054b6eea1b) Thanks [@omridevk](https://github.com/omridevk)! - First-party extensions are folder-installable: `pnpm add @conciv/extension-<name>`, drop a one-line re-export in `conciv/extensions/<name>.tsx`, and both halves load on every supported framework.

  Every published extension (tanstack, terminal, test-runner, whiteboard, recorder) ships per-environment conditional exports: the `browser` condition resolves `dist/client.js`, the `import` condition resolves `dist/server.js`, with per-condition `types`, plus an explicit `./server` subpath. `@conciv/extension-compiler` gains the shared discovery primitives (`@conciv/extension-compiler/dedupe`: provenance-carrying `dedupeExtensions`, `toSortedEntries`, `isExtension`) used by both the server loader and every client path; `loadServerExtensions` now matches files exactly (no directories, no `.d.ts`), treats a missing default export as fatal, and reports every dropped entry with its source and reason. `listExtensionFiles` is the single fs listing primitive.

  Next.js support (Turbopack and `next dev --webpack`, current GA line): `withConciv` generates an app-local `.conciv/extensions-client.gen.tsx` entry (knitwork static imports, idempotent) and wires it to the widget via `turbopack.resolveAlias`/webpack alias as `@conciv/app-extensions`; `register()` runs a chokidar watcher that regenerates the entry live on add/remove. The widget stays lazy (dynamic imports behind the dev-only guard), the engine register entrypoints are stubbed out of Next edge-runtime compilations, and the generated client module now threads a resolved dedupe entry so dist-mode consumers boot. The tanstack extension renders a mount-time composer chip as its client-active surface and degrades gracefully in apps without a TanStack router.

### Patch Changes

- [`c25f76d`](https://github.com/conciv-dev/conciv/commit/c25f76d9cc208c21b15e4444491aa073b680e195) Thanks [@omridevk](https://github.com/omridevk)! - The dist widget now boots cleanly in real consumer vite apps: the plugin pre-warms the widget module graph (`server.warmup`) so a cold dep-optimizer sees every widget dependency before its first run instead of re-optimizing mid-flight (504 Outdated Optimize Dep, full reloads); `optimizeDeps.exclude` yields to another plugin's `include` (vite-plugin-solid hosts like solid-start no longer crash with "entry point solid-js cannot be marked as external"); Solid singleton dedupe/exclude ids apply only where resolvable from the app root, fixing vite 7 hosts and React hosts whose optimized deps embed Solid (TanStack devtools).

## 0.0.8

### Patch Changes

- [#55](https://github.com/conciv-dev/conciv/pull/55) [`05dd101`](https://github.com/conciv-dev/conciv/commit/05dd101ff9401cbdfd5545cffa63f4bb3cfd2fbf) Thanks [@omridevk](https://github.com/omridevk)! - Client/server now talk over a single typed oRPC contract (`@conciv/contract`), with persistence extracted into `@conciv/db`; the remaining bespoke HTTP surface is limited to the MCP route and the terminal WebSocket.

  The server stack moved from h3/srvx to hono behind one `@conciv/serve` wrapper for `@hono/node-server`, and the extension bundler was split out of the vite plugin into a standalone `@conciv/extension-compiler`.

  The terminal gains a narrative activity rail (a resizable, open-by-default timeline of session activity), and the pty now spawns at the attaching client's fitted size instead of bouncing through a fixed geometry on every attach.
