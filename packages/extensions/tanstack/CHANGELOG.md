### Patch Changes

- [#126](https://github.com/conciv-dev/conciv/pull/126) [`85ad5da`](https://github.com/conciv-dev/conciv/commit/85ad5da09b83fa1a263578620d9ad2054b6eea1b) Thanks [@omridevk](https://github.com/omridevk)! - First-party extensions are folder-installable: `pnpm add @conciv/extension-<name>`, drop a one-line re-export in `conciv/extensions/<name>.tsx`, and both halves load on every supported framework.

  Every published extension (tanstack, terminal, test-runner, whiteboard, recorder) ships per-environment conditional exports: the `browser` condition resolves `dist/client.js`, the `import` condition resolves `dist/server.js`, with per-condition `types`, plus an explicit `./server` subpath. `@conciv/extension-compiler` gains the shared discovery primitives (`@conciv/extension-compiler/dedupe`: provenance-carrying `dedupeExtensions`, `toSortedEntries`, `isExtension`) used by both the server loader and every client path; `loadServerExtensions` now matches files exactly (no directories, no `.d.ts`), treats a missing default export as fatal, and reports every dropped entry with its source and reason. `listExtensionFiles` is the single fs listing primitive.

  Next.js support (Turbopack and `next dev --webpack`, current GA line): `withConciv` generates an app-local `.conciv/extensions-client.gen.tsx` entry (knitwork static imports, idempotent) and wires it to the widget via `turbopack.resolveAlias`/webpack alias as `@conciv/app-extensions`; `register()` runs a chokidar watcher that regenerates the entry live on add/remove. The widget stays lazy (dynamic imports behind the dev-only guard), the engine register entrypoints are stubbed out of Next edge-runtime compilations, and the generated client module now threads a resolved dedupe entry so dist-mode consumers boot. The tanstack extension renders a mount-time composer chip as its client-active surface and degrades gracefully in apps without a TanStack router.
