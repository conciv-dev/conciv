### Patch Changes

- [#625](https://github.com/conciv-dev/conciv/pull/625) [`060d32a`](https://github.com/conciv-dev/conciv/commit/060d32a66de6929c085a431a9676ac3759e6ff4c) Thanks [@omridevk](https://github.com/omridevk)! - New `@conciv/ai` package: the chat primitives conciv is built from, on top of TanStack AI. Three
  entries, with the message, part and event types living in `@conciv/protocol`:

  - `@conciv/ai/server`: `createChatServer`, which runs every turn through `chat()` with the library's
    persistence (`withPersistence`, streaming snapshots), locks, the local-process sandbox and its
    command policy, code mode with `discover_tools`, WebSocket and SSE delivery with resume, stop and
    hydrate; plus the CLI text adapters (`claudeCode`, `codex`, `opencode`, `acp`, `makeTextAdapter`).
    The patched `@tanstack/ai-sandbox` and `@tanstack/ai-code-mode` ship inside its dist.
  - `@conciv/ai/client`: `createChat` and `createChatSession`, the Solid chat session on the library's
    `useChat` (connection, hydration, stop, approvals). The widget's chat runs on it.
  - `@conciv/ai/testkit`: the story connection and chunk builders for stories and tests.

  `bippy` stays held at its current version.

  New `@conciv/chat` package: the conciv chat plane on top of `@conciv/ai/server` (`createChatPlane`):
  the Drizzle chat stores over `@conciv/db`'s tables, transcript import, compaction with a divider that
  keeps the history, boot recovery, approvals as the library's deny-and-retry flow with once and
  session grants, `conciv_ui` questions, and the code-mode capabilities with the result cap. Tools that
  need approval stay ordinary tool calls outside code mode. Core wires the plane and keeps sessions,
  slash commands and the session bus; `@conciv/core`, `@conciv/db`, `@conciv/harness` and
  `@conciv/protocol` no longer depend on `@tanstack/ai*`.

  The widget posts "Approved: <title>" after an approval and refreshes hydration on stop and on a run
  error. Approval tools called over RPC from outside the widget (the `conciv` CLI, curl) are refused
  with the same ask, and a retry after approving runs.

  The agent prompts and the `react-introspection` skill name `discover_tools`; `external_catalog` is
  gone. `@conciv/harness-testkit` builds on the `@conciv/ai` event types and chunk builders and reaches
  tools through `/api/mcp` with `discover_tools`. `discover_tools` carries each tool's
  output shape and declared error codes.

### Patch Changes

- [#566](https://github.com/conciv-dev/conciv/pull/566) [`ec28181`](https://github.com/conciv-dev/conciv/commit/ec28181dc8b49c979e6bd36284eb7148bee092f3) Thanks [@omridevk](https://github.com/omridevk)! - The claude harness now disables the native `AskUserQuestion` tool. It resolves through a host-rendered dialog the CLI only offers over the Agent SDK control channel, which our adapter (a plain `claude -p` spawn) does not have, so the CLI failed closed and answered itself with "The user did not answer the questions" in about 400ms: the widget never showed anything and the agent carried on with an answer nobody gave. Asking now goes through the `conciv_ui` tool's existing `choices` kind, which gains `multiSelect` (the user picks several options, and the answer comes back as a list) and `allowOther` (a free-text row for an answer that is not on the list).

- [#597](https://github.com/conciv-dev/conciv/pull/597) [`d07737b`](https://github.com/conciv-dev/conciv/commit/d07737b093afd7e373ca7abd7c918cc572bd83d6) Thanks [@omridevk](https://github.com/omridevk)! - `claudeExecutable` now throws if the plugin directory path contains whitespace, instead of silently
  producing a broken spawn. `@tanstack/ai-claude-code` builds its argv by splitting the executable
  string on plain spaces with no quoting, so a plugin dir with a space in it would previously mangle
  the `claude` invocation.

- [#597](https://github.com/conciv-dev/conciv/pull/597) [`d07737b`](https://github.com/conciv-dev/conciv/commit/d07737b093afd7e373ca7abd7c918cc572bd83d6) Thanks [@omridevk](https://github.com/omridevk)! - Upgrade the @tanstack/ai family 0.43.1 → 0.48.0 in lockstep (ai-client 0.26.0, ai-solid 0.18.3,
  ai-code-mode 0.4.3, ai-isolate-node 0.1.51, ai-isolate-quickjs 0.3.1, ai-mcp 0.3.4, ai-sandbox 0.5.0,
  ai-sandbox-local-process 0.2.4, ai-claude-code/ai-codex 0.4.4, ai-opencode/ai-acp 0.3.4). Upstream
  moved every sibling package's peer range from an exact pin to a caret range, so the pnpm catalog
  comment explaining the old exact-pin poison is rewritten. Code Mode's dynamic binding hook was
  renamed `getSkillBindings` → `getSnippetBindings` upstream; a per-turn `RUN_FINISHED` token-usage
  chunk can now arrive as either the legacy `TokenUsage` shape or the new AG-UI spec `usage[]` array,
  so the run-log fold rebuilds it with `fromSpecTokenUsage` before turning it into a usage snapshot.

- [#616](https://github.com/conciv-dev/conciv/pull/616) [`00f3200`](https://github.com/conciv-dev/conciv/commit/00f32009789ed532dc6cd6f62b6b360c6e37d0c5) Thanks [@omridevk](https://github.com/omridevk)! - Codex's model list and default model now come from codex's own catalog (`~/.codex/models_cache.json`, listed models in codex's priority order) and config (`model` in `~/.codex/config.toml`), instead of a hardcoded `gpt-5.5` that ChatGPT-account codex rejects. The static `@tanstack/ai-codex` list stays as the fallback when the catalog is missing or unreadable.

- [#597](https://github.com/conciv-dev/conciv/pull/597) [`d07737b`](https://github.com/conciv-dev/conciv/commit/d07737b093afd7e373ca7abd7c918cc572bd83d6) Thanks [@omridevk](https://github.com/omridevk)! - Removed the unused Claude `attach` slot (`claudeAttach`, `parseLiveSessions`, `meetsReloadFloor`) and
  its `HarnessAttach`/`HarnessLiveSession`/`HarnessAttachInstall`/`HarnessAttachResult`/`HarnessAttachRemoval`
  protocol types. Nothing in the codebase called `harness.attach`, `candidates()`, `install()`, or
  `uninstall()` outside the deleted `claude/attach.ts` and its own test.

  Consolidated the duplicate `chatBusy`/`busyOf` check (identical bodies in `@conciv/ui-kit-chat` and
  `@conciv/client`) into a single `chatBusy` export from `@conciv/protocol/chat-busy`, which both
  packages already depend on.

  `@conciv/client`'s `stopping` state is now derived from the server-published run lifecycle phase
  (`runSource().lifecycle.phase === 'stopping'`) instead of a local 10s-timeout approximation; deleted
  the now-redundant `createStopState`/`isStopping` local timer and its `@solid-primitives/timer`
  dependency.

- [#597](https://github.com/conciv-dev/conciv/pull/597) [`d07737b`](https://github.com/conciv-dev/conciv/commit/d07737b093afd7e373ca7abd7c918cc572bd83d6) Thanks [@omridevk](https://github.com/omridevk)! - Bump the `@tanstack/ai` family from the 0.48 lockstep to 0.51 (catalog-only, see `pnpm-workspace.yaml`).
  Picks up upstream fix [#1248](https://github.com/TanStack/ai/pull/1248): the client `StreamProcessor`
  dropped the first `TEXT_MESSAGE_CONTENT` delta of an assistant turn that called a tool before
  replying, so every answer that followed a tool call lost its opening text (an opening code fence,
  most visibly).

### Patch Changes

- [#215](https://github.com/conciv-dev/conciv/pull/215) [`ce52c4f`](https://github.com/conciv-dev/conciv/commit/ce52c4ff059e2c701fa81d18b68a793df2b937e8) Thanks [@omridevk](https://github.com/omridevk)! - Every harness now declares init as a capability (`'files' | 'none'`), backed by a per-harness init
  contribution in the new dependency-light `@conciv/harness-init` package, which replaces
  `@conciv/claude-connect`. The `conciv` CLI derives detection and install steps from those
  contributions instead of a hand-listed marker table, and no longer depends on `@conciv/harness`, so
  `npx @conciv/cli@latest init` stops installing every runtime agent SDK. This also makes gemini-cli
  detectable and initializable like its sibling harnesses. `@conciv/harness` consumes
  `@conciv/harness-init` for its own harness contributions; the old `./claude-connect-files` and
  `./claude-connect-state` subpaths are gone.

- [#80](https://github.com/conciv-dev/conciv/pull/80) [`73c451e`](https://github.com/conciv-dev/conciv/commit/73c451e8d4175732a0e3f421300bda19b8dcf45c) Thanks [@omridevk](https://github.com/omridevk)! - Fix the context meter reading cumulative turn usage as context occupancy (issue [#78](https://github.com/conciv-dev/conciv/issues/78), e.g. 386% / 773K of 200K). `@tanstack/ai`'s `RUN_FINISHED` usage is a billing aggregate, not the live context size; each adapter feeds it differently (Claude sums every tool-loop request). Context occupancy is now a distinct `UsageSnapshot.contextTokens` field populated per-harness through a new optional `HarnessHistory.contextTokens(raw)` seam. The Claude harness derives it from the last non-sidechain assistant message's usage in the transcript (`input + cache_read + cache_creation`). The meter's ring/percent/bar render only when a harness reports real occupancy; otherwise the tracker shows honest turn billing totals with no percent-of-window framing.
