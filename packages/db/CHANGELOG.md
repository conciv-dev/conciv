### Patch Changes

- [#625](https://github.com/conciv-dev/conciv/pull/625) [`060d32a`](https://github.com/conciv-dev/conciv/commit/060d32a66de6929c085a431a9676ac3759e6ff4c) Thanks [@omridevk](https://github.com/omridevk)! - New `@conciv/ai` package: the chat primitives conciv is built from, on top of TanStack AI. Three
  entries, with the message, part and event types living in `@conciv/protocol`:

  - `@conciv/ai/server`: `createChatServer`, which runs every turn through `chat()` with the library's
    persistence (`withPersistence`, streaming snapshots), locks, the local-process sandbox and its
    command policy, code mode with `discover_tools`, WebSocket and SSE delivery with resume, stop and
    hydrate; plus the CLI text adapters (`claudeCode`, `codex`, `opencode`, `acp`, `makeTextAdapter`).
    The patched `@tanstack/ai-sandbox` and `@tanstack/ai-code-mode` ship inside its dist.
  - `@conciv/ai/client`: `createChat` and `createChatSession`, the Solid chat session on the library's
    `useChat` (connection, hydration, stop, approvals). The widget's chat runs on it.
  - `@conciv/ai/testkit`: the story connection and chunk builders for stories and tests.

  `bippy` stays held at its current version.

  New `@conciv/chat` package: the conciv chat plane on top of `@conciv/ai/server` (`createChatPlane`):
  the Drizzle chat stores over `@conciv/db`'s tables, transcript import, compaction with a divider that
  keeps the history, boot recovery, approvals as the library's deny-and-retry flow with once and
  session grants, `conciv_ui` questions, and the code-mode capabilities with the result cap. Tools that
  need approval stay ordinary tool calls outside code mode. Core wires the plane and keeps sessions,
  slash commands and the session bus; `@conciv/core`, `@conciv/db`, `@conciv/harness` and
  `@conciv/protocol` no longer depend on `@tanstack/ai*`.

  The widget posts "Approved: <title>" after an approval and refreshes hydration on stop and on a run
  error. Approval tools called over RPC from outside the widget (the `conciv` CLI, curl) are refused
  with the same ask, and a retry after approving runs.

  The agent prompts and the `react-introspection` skill name `discover_tools`; `external_catalog` is
  gone. `@conciv/harness-testkit` builds on the `@conciv/ai` event types and chunk builders and reaches
  tools through `/api/mcp` with `discover_tools`. `discover_tools` carries each tool's
  output shape and declared error codes.

### Patch Changes

- [#597](https://github.com/conciv-dev/conciv/pull/597) [`d07737b`](https://github.com/conciv-dev/conciv/commit/d07737b093afd7e373ca7abd7c918cc572bd83d6) Thanks [@omridevk](https://github.com/omridevk)! - Drizzle `MessageStore` and `MetadataStore` on the ai-persistence schema (`chat_threads`, `chat_metadata`), gated by upstream's `runPersistenceConformance`. `openDb` backfills every legacy `run_messages`/`image_history` row into one thread through `uiMessageToModelMessages`, moves anchor ids into metadata as `{nativeId}`, and records where the still-pending turn starts. The import is idempotent and leaves the legacy tables in place.

  `chat_threads` is now the widget's single record of a session. The read-time merge of the CLI transcript with database-owned history is gone: a snapshot loads the thread and converts it back to UIMessages, and the CLI transcript reaches the widget only through an import that appends the turns the thread does not already hold. Nothing writes `run_messages` or `image_history` any more.

- [#597](https://github.com/conciv-dev/conciv/pull/597) [`d07737b`](https://github.com/conciv-dev/conciv/commit/d07737b093afd7e373ca7abd7c918cc572bd83d6) Thanks [@omridevk](https://github.com/omridevk)! - Run records move to a Drizzle `RunStore` on the `@tanstack/ai-persistence` schema. One durable record now describes a run for both conciv and the library, replacing the parallel `runs` table bookkeeping. A user stop records the cancel through `requestRunCancel` and aborts with `RUN_CANCEL_REASON`, so it is distinguishable from a dropped client, and boot cleanup is a sweep over `listReclaimable` instead of a blanket abort.

- [#597](https://github.com/conciv-dev/conciv/pull/597) [`d07737b`](https://github.com/conciv-dev/conciv/commit/d07737b093afd7e373ca7abd7c918cc572bd83d6) Thanks [@omridevk](https://github.com/omridevk)! - Anchor the transcript merge on native harness record ids and make run records durable.

  The CLI transcript is now sliced at the native record id of the last folded message instead of by matching prompt text, so a turn whose stored copy carries no matching text (an image-only prompt) no longer replays the CLI copy alongside it. Claude, pi, and opencode transcripts mint message ids from their own record identity; codex envelopes carry none, so those keep positional ids and the prompt-boundary fallback.

  Run status, timestamps, and terminal error now persist in a runId-keyed `runs` table, so a subscriber attaching after a server restart still gets the finished run's timing and failure reason. Runs left mid-flight by a dead server are marked aborted when the database reopens.

- [#597](https://github.com/conciv-dev/conciv/pull/597) [`d07737b`](https://github.com/conciv-dev/conciv/commit/d07737b093afd7e373ca7abd7c918cc572bd83d6) Thanks [@omridevk](https://github.com/omridevk)! - Delete parallel structures in the chat plane: the `toChatTool` and `makeConcivSandbox`-adjacent wrappers, the hand-rolled per-session promise chain (now `InMemoryLockStore` from `@tanstack/ai`), the duplicated code-mode event mapping on the MCP path, the abort-safe sandbox process wrappers, and the JSON-schema dereferencer (tool schemas must now serialize to one inline schema, enforced at registration).

  **Breaking for extension authors: tool names are now plain snake_case identifiers.** conciv adopts TanStack AI's tool-naming convention instead of its own dotted one. `registerTool` validates every name against `^[a-z][a-z0-9_]*$` and rejects anything else with a message naming the tool and the rule, because the code-mode isolate binds each tool as a JavaScript function (`external_<name>`). Every first-party tool was renamed accordingly: `page.<verb>` to `page_<verb>`, `server.<op>` to `server_<op>`, `canvas.*`/`comment.*`/`ios.*` to `canvas_*`/`comment_*`/`ios_*`, `pin.setState` to `pin_set_state`, `anchor.resolve` to `anchor_resolve`, `element.reference` to `element_reference`, and the `tanstack.*` family to `tanstack_*` with camelCase verbs lowered to snake (`tanstack.dataEntries` becomes `tanstack_data_entries`). Rename your own dotted tools; the CLI command shape (`conciv tools page fill`) is unchanged. Code-mode bindings are now `external_<name>` straight from `toolsToBindings`, so `sanitizeIdentifier`/`uniqueIdentifier` are gone from `@conciv/extension`, and the tool-name normalizer only strips CLI and bridge prefixes (`mcp__*__`, `tanstack_`) — it no longer folds punctuation. Tool names stored in old transcripts are left exactly as written and will render as unknown tools.

  **The TanStack extension now registers one tool per verb.** The `tanstack_page_*` namespace is gone: each page verb is registered once, under its agent-facing name, as the client tool that implements it — `tanstack_page_router_state` is now simply `tanstack_router_state`, and the server-side re-wraps that used to shadow those verbs (`routerStateServer`, `routeTreeServer`, `loaderDataServer`, `queryCacheServer`, `navigateServer`, `routerInvalidateServer`, `backServer`, `queryInvalidateServer`, `queryRefetchServer`) are deleted along with `src/shared/verb-defs.ts` and `src/client/verbs.ts`. Removed tool names: `tanstack_page_detect`, `tanstack_page_router_state`, `tanstack_page_route_tree`, `tanstack_page_data_entries`, `tanstack_page_data_get`, `tanstack_page_data_invalidate`, `tanstack_page_data_refetch`, `tanstack_page_errors_snapshot`, `tanstack_page_query_cache`, `tanstack_page_query_invalidate`, `tanstack_page_query_refetch`, `tanstack_page_navigate`, `tanstack_page_router_invalidate`, `tanstack_page_back`, and `tanstack_invalidate` (renamed to `tanstack_router_invalidate`). New names for verbs that had no curated tool: `tanstack_detect`, `tanstack_data_entries`, `tanstack_data_invalidate`, `tanstack_errors_snapshot`. Results lose the `{result: …}` envelope — `tanstack_router_state` answers `{location, matches}` directly. The page plane only transports plain records, so the three verbs whose natural answer is not one name their payload: `tanstack_data_entries` answers `{entries}`, `tanstack_errors_snapshot` answers `{errors}`, and `tanstack_loader_data` answers `{routeId, data}` (the routeId tells you which match answered when you omit it).

  **The run record is the only source of run liveness.** `packages/core/src/chat/live-runs.ts` is deleted. The four seams that used to ask a process-local map whether a session was busy now ask the `RunStore`: the extension server's `sessions.chatBusy`, the session scope's `run.live()`, the sessions RPC listing, and `subscribeSession`. All four are async as a result — `chatBusy` and `run.live()` return promises, and `listSessionMetas` takes a `running` set resolved once per list call from the new `runningThreadIds` query instead of a per-row predicate. What stays in memory is only what a database cannot hold: each in-flight run's `AbortController` and its driver promise, keyed by run id in `run-drivers.ts` and dropped when the run settles, plus the per-session lock in `session-locks.ts`.

  **One tool invalidates a route's loader data, not two.** `FrameworkClientCore['data']` loses its `refetch(key)` member: refetching a route was byte-identical to invalidating it — both call the router's `invalidate` — so the surface now carries only `invalidate(key)`, exposed to the agent as `tanstack_data_invalidate`. `QueryCacheSurface.refetch` and `tanstack_query_refetch` are untouched, because refetching a query really is not invalidating a route.

  `snapshotToTokenUsage` (only consumer was its own test), the self-referential
  `ChatMessageSchema`/`ChatRequestSchema` (no import site anywhere), and the `replies`
  table plus `writeReply`/`replyFor` (truncated on every boot, no non-test consumer).
  A drizzle migration drops the `replies` table.

  Delete our bespoke `APPROVAL_REQUESTED_EVENT`/`ApprovalRequest`/`aguiApprovalRequestedFor`
  helpers in `@conciv/protocol`; the single emitter in `@conciv/core`'s permission gate now
  builds `@tanstack/ai`'s `ApprovalRequestedEvent` directly and stamps it with tanstack
  run/thread metadata via `withTanstackMetadata`, keeping the event name string sourced from
  `@tanstack/ai-sandbox`'s `APPROVAL_REQUESTED_EVENT` constant.

Drizzle's own `readMigrationFiles` parses the `drizzle/` folder during the package build and its `MigrationMeta` output is emitted as a gitignored generated module that `migrateSync` executes at runtime — no SQL duplicated in the repo and no hand-rolled migration parser.

  The server stack moved from h3/srvx to hono behind one `@conciv/serve` wrapper for `@hono/node-server`, and the extension bundler was split out of the vite plugin into a standalone `@conciv/extension-compiler`.

  The terminal gains a narrative activity rail (a resizable, open-by-default timeline of session activity), and the pty now spawns at the attaching client's fitted size instead of bouncing through a fixed geometry on every attach.
