Delete parallel structures in the chat plane: the `toChatTool` and `makeConcivSandbox`-adjacent wrappers, the hand-rolled per-session promise chain (now `InMemoryLockStore` from `@tanstack/ai`), the duplicated code-mode event mapping on the MCP path, the abort-safe sandbox process wrappers, and the JSON-schema dereferencer (tool schemas must now serialize to one inline schema, enforced at registration).
