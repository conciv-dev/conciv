The claude harness now disables the native `AskUserQuestion` tool. It resolves through a host-rendered dialog the CLI only offers over the Agent SDK control channel, which our adapter (a plain `claude -p` spawn) does not have, so the CLI failed closed and answered itself with "The user did not answer the questions" in about 400ms: the widget never showed anything and the agent carried on with an answer nobody gave. Asking now goes through the `conciv_ui` tool's existing `choices` kind, which gains `multiSelect` (the user picks several options, and the answer comes back as a list) and `allowOther` (a free-text row for an answer that is not on the list).
