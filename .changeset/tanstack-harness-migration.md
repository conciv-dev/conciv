'@conciv/core': patch
---

Harness turns now run on the TanStack AI stack: every harness is a `chatConfig` returning a published `@tanstack/ai-*` text adapter (claude on `claudeCodeText`, codex on `codexText`, opencode on `opencodeText`, gemini-cli on `acpCompatible`), executed through `chat()` with a local-process sandbox and the conciv permission gate as middleware. The bespoke spawn/decode pipeline, the PreToolUse hook route, and the per-harness arg builders are gone.
