"Refresh the conversation" is now a real operation instead of a silent stream abort. `chatConnection.refresh()` returns a promise that settles only once the reopened subscription has delivered its first chunk, so callers can await a reconnect rather than fire and forget. A pane-level refresh coordinator (`makeRefreshCoordinator`) awaits that reconnect alongside explicit refetches of the session-scoped queries — the session list that feeds usage and cost, the session markers, and the tool captures — and exposes an `isRefreshing` accessor derived from a single phase signal.

Both entry points go through the coordinator. The panel's session menu row is now a `Popover.CloseTrigger`, so the menu dismisses on click, and the menu trigger swaps its ellipsis for a spinning refresh glyph (reduced-motion honored through the existing `anim-tool-spin` shortcut) with its accessible name changing to "Refreshing the conversation". The pop-out and quick-terminal toolbar buttons spin and disable the same way. The transcript stays on screen throughout — the refresh never re-arms the loading skeleton — and start, success, and failure are announced in the live region.
