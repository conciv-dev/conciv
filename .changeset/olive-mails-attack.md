Tool results read as data again. An exec run now shows its console logs and its typed result separately: objects and arrays open as a JSON tree, strings stay strings, and scalars sit on one compact line instead of being flattened into an escaped one-line blob. Meta-driven cards with an object output schema take the same structural path. Page script steps label themselves with the first line of the script they ran, and a long value no longer squeezes the step target out of a narrow session card.
