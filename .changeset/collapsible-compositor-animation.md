Collapsible open/close (tool cards, chain-of-thought groups) now animates `grid-template-rows` via CSS keyframes instead of the box-model `height`. `@zag-js/collapsible` determines whether an exit animation exists by reading the content element's computed `animationName`, and waits for `animationend` before letting the state settle; a CSS `transition` on `height` never fires that event, so the earlier attempt to swap in a `transition`-based approach snapped instantly instead of animating. The content element is a CSS grid with a single `1fr`/`0fr` row track; its child wrapper carries `overflow: hidden` and `min-height: 0` so the collapsed track visually and structurally clips to zero. `prefers-reduced-motion` is honored on both variants. Measured in the live-widget rig: toggle-window p99 dropped to 9.3ms versus 16-17.5ms for the prior height-based animation; the worst-case catastrophic frames were independent of which toggle animation was in flight.

`usePauseFollowOnToggle` previously waited on `animationend` for every toggle, including under `prefers-reduced-motion`, where `motion-reduce:animate-none` means no animation ever starts and no `animationend` ever fires. Thread auto-follow stayed paused for the full 1000ms ceiling on every toggle for reduced-motion readers. The hook now checks the toggled element's computed `animationName` synchronously after the toggle: when it is `none` (no animation running), follow releases immediately instead of waiting on an event that will never arrive.
