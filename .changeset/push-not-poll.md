The widget no longer polls. `meta.hubAgents` is an event iterator the engine pushes whenever the conciv home db changes on disk, so an agent connected or disconnected from the CLI shows up at once. The engine staleness read refreshes on reconnect and refocus instead of a timer, and reachability comes only from the engine socket (`engineProbeRefetchInterval` and `voteEngineProbeSettled` are gone). The recorder panel follows a `replay` stream until the recording can be replayed and a pushed `events` stream for the live tail, replacing its 1 s polls.
