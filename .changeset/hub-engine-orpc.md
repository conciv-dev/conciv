The hub talks to engines over the typed oRPC contract. `conciv mcp serve` now calls `code.execute`, `code.discover`, `code.describe`, `tabs.get` and `page.queue.wait` instead of reading MCP text from `/api/mcp`, so a queue call becomes an MCP task whenever the script started a queue, whatever it returns, and a script that only returns a queue-shaped object no longer does. `GET /api/tabs` is replaced by `tabs.list` / `tabs.get`; an engine without them is reported as too old. `/api/mcp` and `code.execute` run one shared engine function. The image helpers (`imagesIn`, `withoutImages`, `imageBlocks`) move from `@conciv/ai/server` to `@conciv/protocol/chat-message-types`.
